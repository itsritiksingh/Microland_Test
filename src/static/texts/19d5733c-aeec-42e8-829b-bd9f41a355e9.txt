After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast
armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading
eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206."17] The sultanate was to control
much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian
elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and
customs. 2181119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India

centralised, and uniform rule,129! Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar,
the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an
emperor who had near-divine status.!!28] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues

peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.!129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during
much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, 4291 resulting in greater patronage
