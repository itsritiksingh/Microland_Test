# Document Upload & Query Flow

This project enables uploading documents, converting them to an image format (JPEG), performing OCR, creating embeddings, and querying the processed content via a vector database and a retrieval chain using the Ollama Orca 3B model.

## Features
- **Document Upload:** Supports document uploads, converts them to JPEG, and extracts text via Tesseract OCR.
- **Embeddings:** Creates embeddings using cache embedding on top of Ollama Orca 3B and stores them in an in-memory vector database.
- **Query Flow:** Fetches relevant context from the vector DB and uses Ollama Orca 3B with a retrieval chain to provide responses based on the query.

## Flows

### 1. Upload Flow

1. **Upload Document**  
   User uploads a document (e.g., PDF or DOC).
   
2. **Convert to JPEG**  
   The document is converted to a series of JPEG images.
   
3. **OCR via Tesseract**  
   Tesseract OCR is used to extract text from the JPEG images.
   
4. **Create Embeddings**  
   The extracted text is passed to the cache embedding mechanism, which uses Ollama Orca 3B to generate embeddings.
   
5. **Store in In-Memory Vector Database**  
   The embeddings are stored in an in-memory vector database for quick retrieval during the query process.

### 2. Query Flow

1. **Fetch Relevant Context from Vector DB**  
   A user query is processed, and the relevant context is fetched from the in-memory vector database based on stored embeddings.
   
2. **Query Ollama Orca 3B via Retrieval Chain**  
   The retrieved context is used as input to Ollama Orca 3B, which processes the query through a retrieval chain and generates the appropriate result.

## Technologies Used
- **Tesseract:** For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from uploaded documents.
- **Ollama Orca 3B:** For generating embeddings and responding to queries via a retrieval chain.
- **In-Memory Vector Database:** For storing and retrieving embeddings to provide relevant context during querying.
- **Cache Embedding:** To optimize and reuse embeddings generated by Ollama Orca 3B.
